#### EXPLANATION
Everyday people in Africa die of hunger. While in Africa contains about 20% of the world livestock. But huge losses of livestock create a shortage of food.
We've created navigation app that provide pasters all info that they need to have secure way. In the app herder can easily find different mapâ€™s layers: water sources and grazing lands, weather and fires and tsetse flies outbreaks, nearest settlements and even market prices there.
Most of the data is updated in real-time, so herders always have up-to-date information and receive alerts of the impending threat. Also he can upload part of the map beforehand and have access to stored info.
In the future our map will grow due to crowdsourcing and aggregation of even more useful open data sources to help all farmers on the Earth and, hopefully, to save Africa from hunger.
